[] Good: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 (9 is good but could be improved)

Analysis for the bad reviews:
10. The price point of the AR-Explorer Glasses does not justify the underwhelming immersive experiences. To address this concern, consider offering discounts or promotions to attract more customers and improve the overall value proposition. Additionally, invest in enhancing the virtual safaris and hidden wonders to meet customer expectations.
11. The AR-Explorer Glasses did not live up to my expectations, and I believe they are overpriced. To regain my trust, consider offering a refund or replacement with a more advanced model that better aligns with my needs and budget. Additionally, gather feedback from other customers to identify areas for improvement and communicate these updates to potential buyers.
